# RelaxNG Gap Analysis Fixtures

Test fixtures generated by `scripts/relaxng-audit.py` for the Tier 1 gap analysis
(RelaxNG schema coverage). These test HTML5 content model rules that epubcheck
enforces via RelaxNG/Jing and reports as RSC-005.

## Categories

### Block-in-Inline Violations (`xhtml/rng-*-contains-*.xhtml`)

Block-level elements (div, ul, table, etc.) inside phrasing-only parents
(p, h1-h6, span, em, strong, etc.). This is the most common content model
violation in real-world EPUBs.

### Restricted Children Violations (`xhtml/rng-*-contains-*.xhtml`)

Elements with restricted allowed children: ul/ol can only contain li,
tr can only contain td/th, select can only contain option/optgroup, etc.

### Void Element Violations (`xhtml/rng-*-with-content.xhtml`)

Void elements (br, hr, img) with child content, which is not allowed.

## Generating

```bash
python3 scripts/relaxng-audit.py --generate-tests      # regenerate fixtures
python3 scripts/relaxng-audit.py --json                 # machine-readable report
python3 scripts/relaxng-audit.py                        # full text report
```

## Status

Implemented in epubverify:
- Block-in-phrasing detection (`checkBlockInPhrasing` in content.go)
- Restricted children validation (`checkRestrictedChildren` in content.go)

Not yet implemented:
- Void element children detection
- Transparent content model inheritance
- Interactive element nesting (beyond nested `<a>`)
- Input type-specific attribute validation
